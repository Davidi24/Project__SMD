# Food Delivery Service - Project Description

Our project is a food delivery system that allows users to order food from their favorite restaurants and have it delivered to their doorstep. The system includes functionalities such as user authentication, restaurant search and selection, menu browsing and item selection, order placement and payment, order tracking and delivery status, user ratings and reviews, restaurant management interface, and delivery management interface.
This food delivery system is designed to provide a convenient and efficient way for users to order food and for restaurants to manage their orders and delivery settings. Our goal is to deliver a user-friendly and reliable system that meets the needs of both customers and restaurant owners/managers.

1) Menu and ordering system: The app should display menus for different restaurants and allow customers to browse through different dishes and place orders easily.

5) Convenient and secure payment options:Allow food delivery software users to add numerous payment methods in the application and switch between them instantly. Also, ensure connectivity with the introduced payment systems so there will be no transaction failures or delays. Finally, do not forget to secure all transactions and the client's payment data with tokenization, data encryption, and transaction verification tools. Even minor payment safety issues can be damaging to your reputation or even make you liable.
