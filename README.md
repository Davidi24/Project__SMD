Project

1) Menu and ordering system: The app should display menus for different restaurants and allow customers to browse through different dishes and place orders easily.
2) Real-time tracking: The app should provide real-time tracking of the order status and delivery personnel, so customers can know when their food will be delivered.
3) Transport menu: the app should allow the user to choose their transport: by walk, motor-bike, car by increasing or decreasing the price.
