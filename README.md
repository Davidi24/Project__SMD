# Food Delivery Service - Project Description

Our project is a food delivery system that allows users to order food from their favorite restaurants and have it delivered to their doorstep. The system includes functionalities such as user authentication, restaurant search and selection, menu browsing and item selection, order placement and payment, order tracking and delivery status, user ratings and reviews, restaurant management interface, and delivery management interface.

This food delivery system is designed to provide a convenient and efficient way for users to order food and for restaurants to manage their orders and delivery settings. Our goal is to deliver a user-friendly and reliable system that meets the needs of both customers and restaurant owners/managers.

## Different User Levels
a) Customer authentication: This level of authentication is used to identify and verify the identity of the customer who is placing the order. Customers may be required to provide their name, email address, phone number, and/or other personal information to create an account with the food delivery service.

b) Restaurant authentication: This level of authentication is used to identify and verify the identity of the restaurant that is fulfilling the order. Restaurants may be required to provide their business name, address, phone number, and/or other information to create an account with the food delivery service.

c) Delivery person authentication: This level of authentication is used to identify and verify the identity of the delivery person who is responsible for delivering the order to the customer. Delivery persons may be required to provide their name, email address, phone number, and/or other personal information to create an account with the food delivery service. They may also be required to provide additional information, such as a driver's license and vehicle registration, to ensure that they are qualified and authorized to make deliveries on behalf of the food delivery service.

d) Administrator authentication: This level of authentication is used to identify and verify the identity of the administrator who is responsible for managing the food delivery service. Administrators may have access to sensitive information such as customer data, restaurant data, and delivery person data, as well as the ability to perform actions such as creating and modifying user accounts, managing orders and payments, and generating reports. As a result, administrator accounts may require additional security measures such as two-factor authentication or biometric authentication to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to the system.
